<p>This is my first time creating this website. I was born and raised in
  the bay area because everything is so special about this place as I called home.
  I want to try new innovating things that made me want to create art as a hobby.
  I had experienced in different medium. Such as, painting, printmaking, drawing, photogrpahy
  and ceramics. These skills made me feel joy because of the good learning expierece.
  Outside of school, I do volunteer at the Chruch to serve for a church community. It took me 
  a while to realize about how hard work can define a person who have the confident and skills 
  tha can balance school and life. I enjoy almost all of the different medium, especially
  designing on computer tech. I hope that I can do well smoothly and sturdy. Therefore,
  I want to explore the places that I wanna go travel and things that I am passionate in my
  interest.</p>
