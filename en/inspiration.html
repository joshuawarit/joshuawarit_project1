      <h4><p>walt disney has been a part of my childhood memories because he inspired everyone by creating the art of elevating animation into a serious, high-quality medium through technological innovation, 
        such as pioneering sound, color, and the multi-plane camera. 
        through his drawing of animated characters, making books, building disney theme parks, and engaging in other activities, 
        walt disney produced art that was filled with joy and laughter. 
        walt disney has influenced me to continue drawing with passion, and I admire him for it.</p></h4>
